# Code of Conduct{#codeofconduct}

## Scientific integrity

Our lab and UO are committed to ensuring research integrity. We take a hard line on research misconduct. Fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism are not acceptable for any reason. You can read about the University of Oregon’s policies here:

- [Responsible Conduct of Research](https://research.uoregon.edu/manage/research-integrity-compliance/responsible-conduct-research)
- [Instruction of RCR](https://research.uoregon.edu/manage/research-integrity-compliance/responsible-conduct-research/core-principles-rcr-instruction)
- [Research Misconduct](https://research.uoregon.edu/manage/research-integrity-compliance/allegations-research-misconduct)
- [Allegations of Research Misconduct](https://policies.uoregon.edu/vol-2-academics-instruction-research/ch-6-research-general/allegations-research-misconduct)

Research misconduct is largely the result of the pressure to publish, which is currently accomplished largely by finding statistically significant and interesting or novel results. If you are feeling pressured to publish a lot, talk about these pressures with us and your lab mates -- we should all support each other as we navigate the competing forces on our time and focus. However, pressure to publish is never an excuse to engage in research misconduct. Remember that fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism is antithetical to the goals of science. Research misconduct will harm you in the long run and also harm our field. It is never worth it. 

If you suspect someone else of engaging in research misconduct, you have a duty to report it. You can notify:

- Us (Sara or David)
- The UO’s Research Integrity Officer (RIO), Cassandra Moseley [(cmoseley@uoregon.edu)](mailto:cmoseley@uoregon.edu)

If you have any questions about research misconduct, you can contact Sheryl Johnson at 541-346-2510 or via email: [sherylj@uoregon.edu](mailto:sherylj@uoregon.edu).

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to ensuring a safe, friendly, and accepting environment for anyone who comes to the lab, regardless of whether they are an official lab member or a guest. We do not tolerate any physical or verbal harassment or discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, or religion. We will not tolerate intimidation, stalking, following, unwanted photography or video recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Finally, it should go without saying that lewd language and behavior have no place in the lab, including any lab outings.  

You can read about the UO Student Code of Conduct [here](https://dos.uoregon.edu/social-misconduct). 

If you are experiencing harassment or discrimination, here are resources available to you:

- [UO Bias Education and Response Team](https://dos.uoregon.edu/bias)
- [Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance](https://investigations.uoregon.edu/policies) (e.g., harassment, abuse of power, discrimination)

Graduate students have additional resources at hand, including reporting issues of bias, discrimination and harrassment to the [Committee for an Inclusive Community](https://psychcic.uoregon.edu/#:~:text=CIC%20Committee%20for%20an%20Inclusive%20Community%20(CIC)&text=The%20Committee%20for%20an%20Inclusive,inclusive%20environment%20within%20the%20department.), to anyone on the FYP or advising committees, and to the department chair.

Finally, anyone who is responsible for or works with students may find themselves in need of resources. See the following sites for guidance on:

- [Reporting academic misconduct](https://dos.uoregon.edu/files/faculty-guide.pdf)
- If you notice a student exhibiting troubling behaviors, see the page on [assisting students of concern](https://dos.uoregon.edu/assisting-students-concern)
- Remember that student academic records must remain private and confidential. That means you may not discuss a student’s grades with anyone except the student themselves and the instructor of record -- do not share information about students in your class with other GEs, faculty, parents, etc. See the [Student Records Privacy Policy](https://registrar.uoregon.edu/privacy. 

### Sexual Harassment and Assault

A key component of the Code of Conduct is protection and support of victims of sexual harassment and assualt. If you experience this while a member of the PIE lab, here is some important information and links to resources.

First, we (David and Sara) are [student-directed employees](https://investigations.uoregon.edu/student-directed-employee-responsibilities-and-required-action), meaning we are required to:

- Listen to disclosures in a supportive way, including responding with respect and kindness, listen before speaking, be sensitive to needs, and ask if a student is under 18. 
- Consult with a confidential resource, although we do not need to identify you in the process
- Not attempt to investigate the incident for ask for more details than you volunteer
- Connect you with resources
- Follow your wishes. 

Legally, we cannot promise to be confidential, but our reporting requirements end at consulting confidential sources without naming you nor anyone else involved in the incident. 

One of the most serious and debilitating concerns that victims face is the potential for retaliation or other negative consequences associated with reporting. It is therefore important to note that it is the [University of Oregon’s policy](https://policies.uoregon.edu/vol-5-human-resources/ch-11-human-resources-other/student-sexual-and-gender-based-harassment-and) to “protect from retaliation students and employees who make good faith reports under this policy or who participate in a University process initiated in response to a report of prohibited discrimination.”

Additional resources include:

- The [UO Safe Site](https://safe.uoregon.edu/) dedicated to support victims and survivors of sexual assault and harrassment. The [FAQ page](https://safe.uoregon.edu/frequently-asked-questions) has very useful information and may be a good place to start. 
- A 24-hour hotline for victims and survivors: 541-346-SAFE
- [Project Callisto](https://www.projectcallisto.org/) offers a way to report specific perpetrators while minimizing the risks associated with coming forward. There is a [UO-specific Callisto site](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uoregon.callistocampus.org/__;!!C5qS4YX3!WpD_dR3yONTn3XIcd1nP681rj5zbPtVWwyb6xnbvGC6WgUaaXJJ8dpIMobd0GYKQgBs$).
- The [UO Ombuds program](https://ombuds.uoregon.edu/) is a fantastic resource for getting advice if you are not sure how to proceed. They provide "confidential, impartial, independent, and informal" advice. You can speak to someone from their office without having to provide your name and they can help you navigate the choices available to you. They can also help mediate discussions while maintaining confidentiality. If you feel overwhelmed, conflicted, or unsure how to proceed--whether you have been a victim or have had a victim confide in you--the Ombuds program can provide valuable guidance.

## Managing Conflict

Communication is key to minimizing conflicts. For example, this document is an effort to clearly communicate our expectations to reduce the possibility of misunderstandings. If you have concerns about your interaction with us or with anyone else, please don't hesitate to come talk with us. 

If you are uncomfortable speaking with us, speak to another faculty member, such as faculty members serving on your FYP or advising committees, the [Department Chair or Associate Department Chair](https://psychology.uoregon.edu/profiles/admin/), the [UO Ombuds office](https://ombuds.uoregon.edu/), or the [Student Conflict Resolution Center](https://scrc.uoregon.edu/about-scrc). If you wish a conversation to remain anonymous, be sure to indicate that at the start of the conversation.
