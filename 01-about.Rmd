## Values

### Transparency

Science must be verifiable by others. For this reason, we strive to be transparent in our work. We share code, materials and, when possible, data. We will admit mistakes. 

<!-- We also seek to be transparent as teachers and mentors. What this means to us is that we will explain our reasons for designing tasks, assignments, and projects. Students and mentees are welcome to ask and question if they do not understand why they have been asked to do something.  -->

### Curiosity

## Expectations

### Honesty

### Respect
