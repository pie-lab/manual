Awesome tables with kable (PDF) Awesome tables with kable (HTML) How to convert a Google doc to RMarkdown Making slides 13.1.5 Using Zotero with RMarkdown Download and install Zotero. Download and install the Better BibTex add-on. Open Zotero, and go to Preference. Under the Export tab, make sure Default Format is “Better BibTex Citation Key Quick Copy.” Under the Better BibTex tab, make sure the Citation key format is something you’ll find useful. (I recommend [auth:lower][veryshorttitle:lower:alphanum][year]). At this point, you can choose to export your Zotero library to a .bib file, save it to the working directory of your RMarkdown file, and make sure the bibliography line is pointing to that file. Once that’s done, you can simply drag from Zotero to your RMarkdown file, to create in-line citations, and the references section at the end will be created for you. OR, you can install the citr package, which works with your Zotero library, so you don’t need to create a new .bib file manually for each paper. Seems really convenient!

If you want descriptives by group (e.g., a treatment/control or by gender), it will also calculate those and statistical tests (\\(t\\) and \\(\\chi^s\\) both!). The modelsummary package seems very useful and customizable. May also work with all outputs from Markdown and Quarto, unlike sjPlot. 13.1.12 Reproducibility 8 things to make research more findable Ensure that the correct versions of packages are loaded using the groundhog package. 13.1.13 US Census API This is a short tutorial on using the US Census API in word. You’ll need the following: * an API key. You can request one at https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html. * the R package censusapi Your key is used to access the API when working in R. It’s not recommended that you share your key with anyone, nor is anyone allowed to use your key to access the API. For that reason, we recommend creating an R script (census-api-key.R) inside your project folder that assigns your key to an object. This script only needs to contain a single line of code: census_key = &quot;Your Key Here&quot; Do not share this script with anyone. If using GitHub, add the path to this script to the .gitignore file. You can see the .gitignore for this project as an example. To use the API, load the censusapi package and source the key script. Then add the key to your R environment. library(censusapi) source(&quot;census-api-key.R&quot;) Sys.setenv(CENSUS_KEY=census_key) There are many datasets in the API. You can see them by running the code: apis &lt;- listCensusApis() You can View() this object to sort through the datsets. The set of datasets most useful for linking with SAPA data are those from the American Community Survey, especially the 5-year surveys. Look for datasets with acs in the name or acs5 for the 5-year files specifically. If there are surveys in multiple years, you’ll need to know which year (vintage) you would like data from. You can see the variables available in a survey using the listCensusMetadata function. vars = listCensusMetadata( name = &quot;acs/acs5&quot;, vintage = 2019, type = &quot;variables&quot; ) head(vars) name label concept predicateType group limit attributes hasGeoCollectionSupport required B24022_060E Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Service occupations:!!Food preparation and serving related occupations SEX BY OCCUPATION AND MEDIAN EARNINGS IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2019 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) FOR THE FULL-TIME, YEAR-ROUND CIVILIAN EMPLOYED POPULATION 16 YEARS AND OVER int B24022 0 B24022_060EA,B24022_060M,B24022_060MA NA NA B19001B_014E Estimate!!Total:!!$100,000 to $124,999 HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2019 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) (BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN ALONE HOUSEHOLDER) int B19001B 0 B19001B_014EA,B19001B_014M,B19001B_014MA NA NA B07007PR_019E Estimate!!Total:!!Moved from different municipio:!!Foreign born:!!Naturalized U.S. citizen GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY CITIZENSHIP STATUS FOR CURRENT RESIDENCE IN PUERTO RICO int B07007PR 0 B07007PR_019EA,B07007PR_019M,B07007PR_019MA NA NA B19101A_004E Estimate!!Total:!!$15,000 to $19,999 FAMILY INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2019 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) (WHITE ALONE HOUSEHOLDER) int B19101A 0 B19101A_004EA,B19101A_004M,B19101A_004MA NA NA B24022_061E Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Service occupations:!!Building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupations SEX BY OCCUPATION AND MEDIAN EARNINGS IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2019 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) FOR THE FULL-TIME, YEAR-ROUND CIVILIAN EMPLOYED POPULATION 16 YEARS AND OVER int B24022 0 B24022_061EA,B24022_061M,B24022_061MA NA NA B19001B_013E Estimate!!Total:!!$75,000 to $99,999 HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2019 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) (BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN ALONE HOUSEHOLDER) int B19001B 0 B19001B_013EA,B19001B_013M,B19001B_013MA NA NA You’ll also need to know the geography you’re collecting from. You can see the available geographies with similar code: geo = listCensusMetadata( name = &quot;acs/acs5&quot;, vintage = 2019, type = &quot;geography&quot; ) head(geo) name geoLevelDisplay referenceDate requires wildcard optionalWithWCFor us 010 2019-01-01 NULL NULL NA region 020 2019-01-01 NULL NULL NA division 030 2019-01-01 NULL NULL NA state 040 2019-01-01 NULL NULL NA county 050 2019-01-01 state state state county subdivision 060 2019-01-01 state , county county county To match with SAPA data, you’ll want to use the ZCTA or zip code tabulation area geography. Then use the getCensus function to import data using the API. For example, if I wanted to extract the total number of households and people in each ZCTA to match with SAPA, I would use the following: uscensus &lt;- getCensus( name = &quot;acs/acs5/profile&quot;, vars = c(&quot;NAME&quot;, &quot;DP02_0001E&quot;, # number of households &quot;DP05_0001E&quot; # number of persons ), region = &quot;zip code tabulation area&quot;, regionin = &quot;state:*&quot;, vintage = 2019) See more in the censusapi vignette. 13.2 Writing Dan Simons – writing guide EJ Wagenmakers – Teaching graduate students how to write clearly Writing Workshop – includes both tips on how to write (content), as well as the practice of writing regularly.

The journal is aimed at graduate student seminars, so it will be more targeted to general understanding and application among psychologists, rather than to quantitative psychologists. This covers the two-parameter model and the graded response model. da Rocha et al. (2013) – An introduction to Rasch analysis for Psychiatric practice and research This one will be similar to the Edwards article in terms of being aimed at a more general audience. This article will cover a third type of IRT model: the Rasch model. Cook et al. (2005) – Dynamic Assessment of Health Outcomes: Time to Let the CAT Out of the Bag? This is less about the practice of IRT itself but more an intro into some of the potential broader application, especially in medical and educational settings. mirt vignette This will walk through how to use the mirt package in R. I believe mirt can do all three types of models described above.
