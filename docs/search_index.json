["talapas-overview.html", "Chapter 3 Talapas Overview 3.1 Requesting Access 3.2 Using Open OnDemand Interactive Access 3.3 Using Talapas for Batch Jobs", " Chapter 3 Talapas Overview Talapas is the high performance computing cluster managed by Research Advanced Computing Services (aka RACS) at the University of Oregon. Since it is possible (and maybe even best) to get started with Talapas without knowing too much about the capabilities of the system, we will simply point to the main website and the Talapas Knowledge Base for learning more. In this document, the numbered sections below will deal with separate tasks that users in the lab might want to perform on Talapas. If you learn how to do something that is not documented below, please add it to the list, even if you are unsure that others will find it useful. Or, just point to the documentation available online. 3.1 Requesting Access Go to this website to request access to the PIE lab Talapas account. Fill out the New Account Request Form, including pielab as the PIRG. 3.2 Using Open OnDemand Interactive Access The RACS team recommends using an incognito tab in Chrome or Firefox before logging in to Talapas (Safari will not work), as this may help to limit the potential for someone to misuse your credentials. Bear in mind that computing services can be costly so there is more at risk than your personal info (and data). In the browser window, go to: https://talapas-ln1.uoregon.edu Enter your username and password. If you don’t know your credentials (or if you’re not sure you have credentials), visit this page to request access. This will require the approval of a lab PI (Condon or Weston). Since there are fees associated with using the computing cluster, your request will be evaluated based on need and the availability of other options. There is a brief overview of the OnDemand service worth reading — see here. 3.2.1 Loading files for Interactive Access Once you have logged in, it’s fairly intuitive to navigate the the dropdown menus at the top of the browser window. The ‘Files’ dropdown gives several options and each will open a new window. For shared projects, consider using the ‘/projects/pielab/shared’ directory to store your files; otherwise use the directory associated with your username within the pielab directory (in other words, this one: ‘/projects/pielab/[username]’). Within the correct folder, you will want to create a new folder that is specific to each project as this is where you’ll store the input and output files, just as you would if working on your own hard drive. 3.2.2 To launch an interactive session From the OnDemand landing page, click ‘Interactive Apps’/‘Talapas Desktop’. This will load a form that requires entry of the PIRG name (pielab) and a few other fields. There are several things to keep in mind when filling out the form to launch the virtual desktop on Talapas. First, the ‘partition’ field requires selection of one of several options. For a complete list, with associated specs, limitations, and restrictions, see here. For many (most?) jobs, the default ‘interactive’ partition should be fine. For more intense jobs, consider using ‘short’ (gives up to 24 hours) or ‘long’ (up to 2 weeks). Note that ‘interactive’ has a max of 4 CPUs, which equates to about 16G RAM. For reference, my souped up laptop has 32G and a standard MacBook Pro has 16G or maybe 8G if older. Analyses of SAPA data from 2017 or later will routinely kill RStudio with only 16G of RAM (necessitating use of the ‘short’ or ‘long’ partitions). For the number of hours, a good practice is to use the lesser of the max amount of time (this depends on the partition) or a generous guess at the length of time needed. If the analysis runs for a long while and the times out, you will have no output and will have spent the funds anyway. Better to have a chance of getting what you need than running out of time. However, you should also get into the practice of deleting instances that are no longer in use, as this will save money! Otherwise, the expenses will add up until the full time allotment has expired. For the number of cores and total memory, the standard seems to be 4G of memory for each CPU — choose the CPUs accordingly (as best you can). Note however that you can also use GPUs, which seem to have more memory. See here for more info about guessing the right specifications. For SAPA processing, I have done lots of experimenting. Unfortunately, most of the analyses conducted on these data are not able to be parallelized. This means the marginal benefit of invoking additional cores is often small (but not zero). When going from raw data to a version that is Dataverse-ready, this set-up seems to work pretty well: 0 GPU, 192 GB, 14 cores, on the short partition for at least 6 hours. If you seek to use more than 128 GB (as above), your request will end up being completed on either the GPU partition (which has 256 GB per node) or the fat partition (which has something even larger). But, for now anyway, the charges are based on the name of the partition specified. If you’re in a rush, you could specify ‘short,gpu,fat’ in the partition section of the form. This means it will run your job on the first available node, giving priority as listed. As of July 2019, the gpu partition costs twice as much as the short partition ($0.008 per SU) and the fat partition costs 6x as much. 3.2.3 To determine the memory usage of jobs previously run This has to be done through an ssh interface with Talapas. Open a shell and enter this at the prompt: ssh username@talapas-ln1.uoregon.edu followed by your password. To see the memory usage of recent jobs (since midnight of the current day), enter: sacct --format=&#39;JobID,Elapsed,MaxRSS&#39; To get more information on an individual job (recommended), enter: seff &lt;JobID&gt; That last command will return something like: $ seff 9609990 Job ID: 9609990 Cluster: mycluster User/Group: username/talapas State: CANCELLED (exit code 0) Nodes: 1 Cores per node: 8 CPU Utilized: 00:23:25 CPU Efficiency: 3.10% of 12:36:16 core-walltime Job Wall-clock time: 01:34:32 Memory Utilized: 29.12 GB Memory Efficiency: 91.00% of 32.00 GB This job was cancelled after repeated efforts to compile. Note the high ratio of Memory Utilized to Memory Available. It is also possible to learn much more. Try using the code below by entering your own ‘username’ and a date that goes back a few days in place of ‘year-mo-da’. sacct -u &lt;username&gt; -S &lt;year-mo-da&gt; --format=&#39;JobID,Partition,State,AllocCPUS,ReqMem,MaxRSS,TimeLimit,Elapsed&#39; This gives all of the most relevant info (in my opinion) on jobs from the date entered until now, including the final status of the job. Finally, it is also possible to obtain information about specific files. This is useful if trying to determine how much time was needed to generate an output file. From the terminal, try a command like this: ls -l ~/projects/&lt;filename&gt; This will give the size of the file along with the date and time of creation. 3.2.4 To run a live session of RStudio Once you have begun the session (i.e., submitted the form), a new page will load. From here, click the blue button that says ‘Launch noVNC in New Tab’. This button may not be visibe right away as you sit in the queue, waiting for the necessary resources to become available. When you launch the tab, a virtual desktop will launch with a dropdown menu in the upper left called ‘Applications’. Choose ‘Education’/‘Talapas RStudio’. Presumably you can figure out how to manage your workflow from here. 3.2.5 Ending your interactive session Your analyses will continue running until completed, timed-out, or stopped for some other reason (coding errors, etc.). When your analyses are done, you should return to the Open OnDemand main page and click the red ‘Delete’ button. This will stop your usage of the system and associated fees. 3.3 Using Talapas for Batch Jobs Haven’t done this yet! But see here if you want to give it a go. "],

Necessary materials: Git GitHub account with access to PIElab organization Rstudio that is connected to GitHub through your personal account. Go to manual repository. Click on the green Clone or download button. Copy the link that appears. Open RStudio. Create a New Project. Select Version Control and then Git. Name the project ``manual’’ (so it matches the Rproj file that already exists in the repository. Save this project somewhere you will remember. 5.2.2 Updating the manual [using the RStudio GUI] Before you make ANY changes: Open the manual RStudio project. Pull the most recent version of the manual using the blue down arrow. Make any changes to the manual as you think are necessary. In the Build tab in Rstudio, click on Build Book. In the Git tab, click Commit. In the commit message section, briefly (4-5 words max) describe the changes you made. Example: wrote updating manual section. In the window on the left, the easiest thing to do is select everything and click Stage. Ensure all the boxes are checked. This will be slower than only selecting the parts of the book that have changed. However, the nature of an RMarkdown book is many changes affect most parts of the book (because it changes you navigate to them). If you miss a change you have made, the book may not render properly online. Click the Commit Button. Click on the green up arrow to push the book to GitHub, which will update the book online. 5.2.3 Updating the manual [using the terminal in Rstudio] Before you make ANY changes: Open the manual RStudio project. In the terminal window of RStudio, pull the most recent version using this code: git pull Make any changes to the manual as you think are necessary. In the Build tab in Rstudio, click on Build Book. In the Terminal, commit your changes. The easiest way to do this is to type: git add . where the period indicate to include anything. Alternatively, you can add only specific files, if you don’t want to commit everything. For example: git add file.R or: git add path/file.R To commit your changes, type: git commit -m &quot;message here&quot; Be sure to include a message describing the changes. Keep the message short. Finally upload your changes with: git push You’re done! 5.2.4 Requesting updates You may be unable to make changes to the lab manual because you are not authorized to make changes or don’t know the answer to the question. In either of those cases, you make create an issue on the GitHub page to alert the lab to the need for additional material. To do so: Go to the Issues tab on the GitHub page for the lab manual. Click on New Issue and complete the form. Be sure to include as much detail as you can about the issue you have. The more detailed your request, the better the information in the manual will be. Note: create one issue request for each question you have. Don’t put lots of requests into a single issue. Other lab members can take responsibility for this issue by self-assigning the issue. Once material has been added to the manual, the member responsible for resolving the issue should reply to the original poster, including a link to the relevant section. If this meets the need of the original poster, they should reply so and the issue can be marked as closed. "]
