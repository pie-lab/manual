Awesome tables with kable (PDF) Awesome tables with kable (HTML) How to convert a Google doc to RMarkdown Making slides 13.1.5 Using Zotero with RMarkdown Download and install Zotero. Download and install the Better BibTex add-on. Open Zotero, and go to Preference. Under the Export tab, make sure Default Format is “Better BibTex Citation Key Quick Copy.” Under the Better BibTex tab, make sure the Citation key format is something you’ll find useful. (I recommend [auth:lower][veryshorttitle:lower:alphanum][year]). At this point, you can choose to export your Zotero library to a .bib file, save it to the working directory of your RMarkdown file, and make sure the bibliography line is pointing to that file. Once that’s done, you can simply drag from Zotero to your RMarkdown file, to create in-line citations, and the references section at the end will be created for you. OR, you can install the citr package, which works with your Zotero library, so you don’t need to create a new .bib file manually for each paper. Seems really convenient!

The journal is aimed at graduate student seminars, so it will be more targeted to general understanding and application among psychologists, rather than to quantitative psychologists. This covers the two-parameter model and the graded response model. da Rocha et al. (2013) – An introduction to Rasch analysis for Psychiatric practice and research This one will be similar to the Edwards article in terms of being aimed at a more general audience. This article will cover a third type of IRT model: the Rasch model. Cook et al. (2005) – Dynamic Assessment of Health Outcomes: Time to Let the CAT Out of the Bag? This is less about the practice of IRT itself but more an intro into some of the potential broader application, especially in medical and educational settings. mirt vignette This will walk through how to use the mirt package in R. I believe mirt can do all three types of models described above.
