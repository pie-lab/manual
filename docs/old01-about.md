## Values

### Transparency

Science must be verifiable by others. For this reason, we strive to be transparent in our work. We share code, materials and, when possible, data. We will admit mistakes. 

<!-- We also seek to be transparent as teachers and mentors. What this means to us is that we will explain our reasons for designing tasks, assignments, and projects. Students and mentees are welcome to ask and question if they do not understand why they have been asked to do something.  -->

### Curiosity

## Expectations

### Honesty

### Respect


## Network Drive

Files can be shared among lab members using the lab network drive. 

### Accessing the drive on a Mac

1. Go to 'Connect to Server'.
2. If you're off-campus, connect to the UO VPN.
3. Enter the network address: `smb://cas-fs2.uoregon.edu/Psychology/a/PIElab`. (It's worth adding this as a favorite network so you don't have to remember the address again.)
4. Enter your DuckID and your password when prompted. Note that you can only gain access if you have been approved for access. 

### Accessing the drive on a PC
