# Day-to-day Information{#daytoday}

## Lab use

We will use the main lab space, Straub 417, for all-lab meetings and often for individual or small group meetings. You may as well. However, you may not use the main lab for a closed meeting -- that is, you should expect other people to come and use the main lab space during your meeting. If you want to have privacy for a meeting, schedule it elsewhere, like an office or coffee shop.

## Pet Policy

We love pets, and we love having animals around the lab, even if our own creature is too anxious to comfortably hang out during the week. However, we recognize that not everyone is comfortable around animals, for a variety of reasons. Please notify us (Sara or David) if you have allergies or concerns about working near pets in the lab. If a single lab member expresses discomfort, we will be pet-free for the term. We will communicate our policy at the beginning of the term; we will not identify lab members who express discomfort. 

## Sickness policy

**Stay home if you are sick**, and take care of yourself. Both parts are essential to keep others in the lab safe and to ensure you are as productive and efficient as you can be in the long run. It is much better to do nothing for a couple of days and recover than to work tired and distracted. Reschedule your meetings as soon as you can. 

## Respect space

Keep the door to the lab locked at all times, to protect the security of our data and our people. If you’re expecting a guest to the lab, you’re responsible for letting them into the room.

Turn off lights if you are the last one to leave. Sign out of lab computers. 

Clean up after yourself if you eat or make coffee in the lab. Refill the water pitcher if you empty it. Do not leave food in the refrigerator after it has gone bad. 

## Be professional

Be on time to things. Respect that everyone has very busy days and everyone’s time is valuable. Graduate students, think of yourself as an entry-level employee in a field you hope to advance in. Anyone presenting their work, remember that you represent the lab as much as yourself. Treat all members of the department, no matter their role, with respect and patience. Be a good ambassador in the spaces you find yourself in: lab meetings, departmental seminars and brown bags, conference presentations, classes, and even hallways.
